      "CleanBamboo is our signature bamboo lyocell fabric made from 100% organic bamboo—the most resource-efficient plant on the planet. We crush the bamboo into a pulp, then dissolve it into a fine fiber using a non-toxic, closed-loop system, saving 98% of the water. The fiber is spun into yarn and woven into a silk-like fabric that gets softer with every wash. It’s hypoallergenic, thermo-regulating and water-saving.",
